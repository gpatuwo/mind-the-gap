## Common Accessibility Issues

### HTML
- semantic HTML language
http://incandescent.xyz/
- auto engage accessibility mode
- native keyboard AX **
  - features can only be selected via keyboard
  - ex links, buttons, form inputs
- alt text
  - esp missing alt text
- element relationships/context
  - most common: links, form labels, data tables
  - link text
    - screen readers pull up list of all links on page, so frequently these links are out of context
      - eg link labeled as 'click here' = BAD
  - labels
  - data tables
    - readers can't associate rows/columns together as groupings of data
    - need to know header rows

### iplayers
- buttons are not labeled

### CSS
- color, color contrast
- hidden content
  - absolute positioning is ok, readers can still get to info
  - shouldn't use visibility:hidden or display:none bc hides content from screen readers

### Javascript
